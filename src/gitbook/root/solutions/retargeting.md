# Creating a Retargeting Campaign

Retargeting is an ad technique that shows ads based on your product catalog to users who previously interacted with your website or app intending to increase conversions.

To help you create a retargeting campaign from the beginning until it's running we've developed this article, here is what we're going to approach for this purpose:

## Cookie Pool

We start creating and installing a cookie pool on your website, a cookie pool is a database built upon the user's stored cookies. Cookies are small files stored on the user's web browser that contain data about the user's behavior on the internet.

Use the cookie pool feature to gather more data about audience segmentation and enhance campaign performance. Not using it limits data gathering and recommendation models.

### Creating a Cookie Pool

1. On the [BMS homepage](https://console.bluems.com/), in the DMP section, click on Cookie Pools.
2. Click on <img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (36) (1) (1).png" alt="+ cookie pool button" data-size="line"> to create a Cookie Pool.
3. Now you can set a Name and Tags for it.
4. Insert your domain and select the exchanges you desire.
5. Set the period and the size of the cookie pool.
6. Click on <img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (32) (1) (1).png" alt="Save Button" data-size="line"> to save your cookie pool.

### Installing a Cookie Pool

1. On the [Cookie Pools page](https://console.bluems.com/dmp/cookie-pools), select the tab install instructions.
2. Click on <img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (37) (1) (1).png" alt="Copy button" data-size="line"> to copy the cookie pool tag.
3. Add this code to the \<head> tag of the pages where you want your users to be added to the pool.
   * We recommend you ask your website's developer to perform this action.
   * Alternatively, you can install this tag on your website using Google Tag Manager (GTM).

## Catalog Storage Service (CS2)

Once you have created a cookie pool, it's time to build your product catalog. This will enable you to use recommendation models that increase ad conversions by showcasing your products on dynamic banners.

### Creating a Catalog

1. On the [BMS homepage](https://console.bluems.com/), click on Catalogs, in the CS2 section.
2. Click on <img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (38) (1) (1).png" alt="Create Catalog Button" data-size="line"> to create a new catalog.

7. Select the import channel you've run the test, and at the jobs tab you can confirm if the channel is working properly or not, in case of any issues with it, they will be displayed in the column "Issues".

### Products

In this section, you will be able to view all your products. Flag the checkbox of the products and go to the details tab to see more detailed information about it, like the offer ID, for example.

## Trackers

Track your audience's website activities using trackers, and utilize the data to create a product recommendation model based on your catalog.

### Creating Trackers

1. On the [BMS homepage](https://console.bluems.com/), click on Trackers.
2. Click on <img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (42) (1) (1).png" alt="+ tracker button" data-size="line"> to add a new tracker.

### Installing a Tracker on Your Website

After creating your trackers, events, and actions, you must install them on your website to start using them. There are 3 install methods available: Script, Pixel, and Redirect.

* Script
  1. On the [Trackers page](https://console.bluems.com/dmp/trackers), select the desired tracker.
  2. Click on the 'Install Instructions' tab, and choose the event you want to track.
  3. Select the Script option.
  4. If you have configured custom data fields, please use the indicated placeholders to inform the values.\
     Here's an example of how the indicated placeholder for your custom data fields might look to you: <img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (48) (1) (1).png" alt=" Custom data field example" data-size="original">.
  5. Click on <img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (49) (1).png" alt="copy button" data-size="line"> to copy the script.
  6. Add this script to your website's code, on the page where the event will be tracked.
  7. You can also use a tag manager, like Google Tag Manager, to add this script to your website.
* Pixel
  1. After choosing an event on the 'Install Instructions' tab, select the Pixel option.
  2. If you have configured custom data fields, please use the indicated placeholders to inform the values.
  3. Click on <img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (49) (1).png" alt="copy button" data-size="line"> to copy the Pixel tag.&#x20;
  4. Add the Pixel tag to your website's code, on the page where the event will be tracked.
  5. You can also use a tag manager, like Google Tag Manager, to add this script to your website.
* Redirect
  1. After choosing an event on the 'Install Instructions' tab, select the Redirect option.
  2. Provide the URL to which the user should be redirected after the event is captured.
  3. If you have configured custom data fields, please use the indicated placeholders to inform the values.
  4. Click on <img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (49) (1).png" alt="copy button" data-size="line"> to copy the generated URL and use it as it was the URL you provided before.

### Tracker's Metrics Tab

The metrics tab allows you to visualize how your trackers, events, and actions are performing. On the metrics tab of the trackers' page, itÂ´s possible to filter the data that is displayed according to your preference, here are the available filters at the moment:

* "Group By": Select how you want to group the displayed data, by tracker or by event.
* "Visualization":  Select how you want to display your data, metric cards, or table.
* "Period": Select the period that contains the data you need.

The data collected by the trackers makes it possible to show dynamic customized ads to your target, without it, it's impossible to generate or show dynamic banners.

## Recommendation Models&#x20;

Recommendation models are used to fill up your dynamic banners with data about your products based on your catalogs and the tracked activity of your website.

### Creating a Recommendation Model

1. On the [BMS homepage](https://console.bluems.com/), click on Recommendation Models, in the CS2 section.
2. Click on <img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (50) (1).png" alt="Create recommendation model button " data-size="line"> to create a new recommendation model.
3. Set a Name and Tags for it.
4. Select the catalog from which the model will collect data and lead interactions.
5. Click on <img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (51) (1).png" alt="save button" data-size="line"> to save your changes.

If you stop using a recommendation model, we recommend disabling it instead of deleting it, as deleting a model also deletes the data collected by this recommendation model.

### Setting up a Source

Now that we've created our recommendation model, we need to set up some sources for it, there are 2 source types available, DMP trackers and Catalogs (CS2). Using DMP trackers as a source will relate your recommendation model to the data collected by the trackers installed on your website. The Catalogs (CS2) option will relate your recommendation model to your catalog data, establishing a product ranking. Below are the steps to set up a source based on the desired source type:

* DMP Trackers
  1. Select the recommendation models you want to use this source for.
  2. In the Configuration tab click on <img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (52) (1).png" alt="+ add button" data-size="line"> to add a new Source.
  3. Set a Name.
  4. Set a limit of catalog products from which data will be collected.
  5. Choose DMP Tracker as the source's type.
  6. Select the tracker from which you will collect the data.
  7. Select the event configured on the tracker from which you will collect data.
  8. Set the field containing your offer IDs.
  9. Click on <img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (53) (1).png" alt="save button" data-size="line"> to save your changes.
* CS2 Product Ranking
  1. Realize the steps 1-4 above.
  2. Choose CS2 Product Ranking.
  3. Select the action you want to use to rank products for this source.
  4. Inform the period in which metrics will be checked and collected.
  5. &#x20;Click on <img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (54) (1).png" alt="save button" data-size="line"> to save your changes.

Sources are used to bring your product data to your dynamic banner, you must have at least one source for each space available in your dynamic banner, each source fills up only one space at a time, so if you have more spaces than sources, some spaces will be empty on your dynamic banners. We also recommend setting up at least 3 sources per recommendation model.

## Creative Builder

Use the Creative Builder to create blueprints and builds that will help you to create your ads faster.

### Blueprints

Blueprints are models for creating ads quickly and efficiently. These pre-made models allow you to build ads that meet your business needs with ease.&#x20;

Built on web design languages, Blueprints can offer you the flexibility of creating dynamic banners. Even, if you are not familiar with web development languages, you can confidently use one of the pre-made Blueprints available.&#x20;
