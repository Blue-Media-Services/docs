# Data Management Platform (DMP)

Use DMP to collect and manage large volumes of data about your audience's online behavior, then use this data to track your audience and define targets for customized ad campaigns.

## Cookie Pools

A Cookie Pool is a collection or database of users' cookies. Cookies are tiny pieces of data stored in a user's web browser when they visit a website. These cookies record users' online behavior, preferences, and interactions with websites and services. [Learn more about Cookie Pools](cookie-pools.md).

## Trackers

Use trackers to gather data about your website's audience's online behavior and configure events and actions to create recommendation models based on this data, allowing you to run retargeting campaigns. [Learn more about Trackers](trackers.md).

## Identifier Pools

Identifier pools function much like cookie pools but are specifically designed for mobile devices, including Android smartphones, tablets, and iOS products. Each operating system employs its own unique methods to identify users effectively. [Learn more about Identifier Pools](identifier-pools.md).
