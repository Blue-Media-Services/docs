# Install Instructions

After setting up events and actions for your tracker, you have to install it on your website. This can be done by following the instructions on the install instructions tab.&#x20;

To access the trackers' instructions tab, select the tracker you need to install in the trackers'  list. You must choose only one tracker at a time to use this tab. The tab will contain one section for each event created for the selected tracker.

There are 4 install methods available for this feature: Script, Pixel, Redirect, and Apps Flyer. After expanding the section of the event you want to install, you can choose from these options:

## Script

Script-based tracking uses code snippets embedded in a website’s pages to capture user interactions. The script collects data on clicks, time spent on pages, and specific actions taken by visitors. However, it requires that users' browsers have JavaScript enabled; otherwise, it will not function.&#x20;

Events and actions are counted every time the script loads, so it must be installed on specific pages based on what you intend to track. To simplify the installation process, you can also use tag managers like Google Tag Manager (GTM).

These are some advantages of using the Script method:

* **Valuable Data**: Tracks detailed user behaviors, such as clicks, time spent on the page, and navigation paths.
* **Real-Time Analysis**: Provides immediate insights into user activity as it happens.

### Use Cases

Script tracking gathers detailed user behavior directly from your website, helping optimize campaigns and improve marketing performance. Below are key applications of this method:

* **Landing Page Performance**: A Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) company can use a script to monitor how users interact with CTAs on a landing page, optimizing conversion rates.
* **User Journey Analysis**: An e-commerce store can track customer navigation from product pages to checkout, identifying drop-off points.
* **Campaign ROI Measurement**: A digital marketing agency can install scripts on client sites to track traffic from PPC campaigns and attribute conversions.

### How To Install

1. On the BMS Trackers page, click on the Install Instructions Tab.
2. Select the Script option.
3. Use the copy button ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (88).png>) to copy the script displayed.
4. If you have configured custom data fields, use the indicated placeholder to inform the custom data values.
5. Paste the code into your website, precisely on the page where you want this event to be captured.

## Pixel

Pixel tracking involves using an invisible image or embedded code in web pages or emails. When a user accesses the content, the pixel renders and sends back information such as the user’s IP address, device type, and actions taken. This method is widely used in marketing campaigns to measure conversions and ad performance.&#x20;

Events and actions are tracked each time the pixel renders, so it must be installed on specific pages or emails based on what you intend to monitor. To simplify the installation process, you can use tag managers like Google Tag Manager (GTM).

These are some advantages of using the Pixel method:

* **Email and Web Integration**: Works seamlessly in emails and web pages to track opens, clicks, and conversions.
* **Precise Retargeting**: Captures data to create retargeting audiences and improve your ad campaign's relevance.

### Use Cases

Pixel tracking collects data from emails and websites, enabling precise campaign analysis and retargeting. Here are some practical marketing examples:

* **Email Campaign Tracking**: A subscription service can embed a pixel in promotional emails to measure open rates and clicks on discount offers.
* **Ad Retargeting**: A beauty brand can use a pixel to retarget users who viewed a product but didn’t complete a purchase, showing them personalized ads.
* **Lead Generation Optimization**: A real estate agency can install a pixel on its form submission page to track leads generated from specific ad campaigns.

### How To Install

1. On the BMS Trackers page, click on the Install Instructions Tab.
2. Select the Pixel option.
3. Use the copy button ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (88).png>) to copy the image tag displayed.
4. If you have configured custom data fields, use the indicated placeholder to inform the values.
5. Paste the code into your website, or email, precisely where you want this event to be captured.

## Redirect

URL redirect tracking works by sending users through an intermediate link before reaching the final destination. This intermediate step collects valuable data, such as traffic sources, campaign parameters, and user behavior. It is a practical method for tracking clicks and understanding the performance of external campaigns or affiliate links.

These are some advantages of using the Redirect method:

* **Effective Attribution**: Accurately tracks traffic sources and affiliate performance.
* **Campaign-Specific Insights**: Ideal for measuring the success of external or affiliate campaigns.

### Use Cases

URL redirect tracking simplifies performance monitoring by capturing data through intermediary links. Here is how it enhances marketing efforts.

* **Affiliate Marketing**: A VPN provider can offer influencers unique redirect links to track subscriptions and reward top-performing partners.
* **Ad Platform Comparison**: A fitness brand can use redirect links in different ad platforms to determine which platform generates more sign-ups.
* **Email Campaign Effectiveness**: An online education platform can include redirect links in email CTAs to track how many users enroll in courses through the campaign.

### How To Install

1. On the BMS Trackers page, click on the Install Instructions Tab.
2. Select the Redirect option.
3. Inform the URL to where you want to redirect the user after the event is captured.
4. Use the copy button ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (88).png>) to copy the displayed URL.
5. Use the generated URL just as you would use the URL you provided.

After installing your events' trackers you should start receiving data from them, it's possible to follow this process on the metrics tab.&#x20;
