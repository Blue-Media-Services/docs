All features on CS2 have their own metrics tab containing data about aspects related to each one, including performance and processing data.

### Catalog

The Catalog metrics tab is a collection of all metrics available on all features of CS2. Initially, without selecting any catalog, a comparison between your catalogs will be displayed on this tab. Selecting more than one catalog will also show a comparison, this time between the selected catalogs. Picking only one catalog will enable the 'Group by' feature.

There are 3 options available on the 'Group by' feature:

1. Group by Catalog: This will display all the metrics data related to the selected catalog.
2. Group by Import Channel: This will compare the metrics related to the import channels linked to the selected catalog.
3. Group by Recommendation Model: This will compare the metrics related to the recommendation models linked to the selected catalog.

### Products

The products metrics tab contains data about how your website's users interact with your products. Without selecting a product, account-wide metrics data for all your products will be displayed on this tab. Selecting one product will restrict the displayed metrics data to the selected one, and selecting more than one will generate a metrics comparison between the selected products.

### Import Channels

The import channels metrics tab contains data about your importing jobs, such as data processing, performance, and failure rate. Without selecting an Import channel, account-wide metrics data for all your import channels will be displayed on this tab. Selecting one import channel will restrict the displayed metrics data to the selected one, and selecting more than one will generate a metrics comparison between the selected ones.

### Recommendation Models

The recommendation models metrics tab contains data about how your recommendation models are performing.

Selecting one recommendation model will restrict the displayed metrics data to the selected one, and selecting more than one will generate a metrics comparison between the selected ones.
