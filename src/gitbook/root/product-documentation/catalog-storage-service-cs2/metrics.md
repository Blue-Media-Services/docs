# Metrics

All features on CS2 have their own metrics tab containing data about aspects related to each one, including performance and processing data.

### Visualization

We have 2 visualization options available for CS2 Metrics:

*   Metric Cards: This option displays your metrics on cards containing graphics. It's possible to export the data contained in each metric card by clicking on the desired card and then clicking on the download button <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (125).png" alt="" data-size="line">.\

*   Data Table: This option will bring the same data that are on the metric cards in table format. This visualization option allows you to export the data by clicking on the download button <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (125).png" alt="" data-size="line">.  You can also visualize the table in full-screen mode by clicking on ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (126).png>).\

### Time-Frames and Periodicity

One of the features on the metrics tab is defining a time frame and a period in which you want to visualize your catalogs, import channels, products, and recommendation models performances.&#x20;

<div align="center">

</div>

We can select a time frame to visualize the performance of CS2's features within that period. To define a time frame, click on the button that represents the desired period or use the calendar button to set a custom time frame.

Additionally, it's also possible to set a period to define measurement intervals. For example, suppose you select a time frame of 1 day and a period of 1 hour. In that case, all the results from the last day will be displayed and divided into 1 hour periods.

To update your results click on the refresh button <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (122).png" alt="" data-size="original">.

### Catalog

The Catalog metrics tab is a collection of all metrics available on all features of CS2. Initially, without selecting any catalog, a comparison between your catalogs will be displayed on this tab. Selecting more than one catalog will also show a comparison, this time between the selected catalogs. Picking only one catalog will enable the 'Group by' feature.

There are 3 options available on the 'Group by' feature:

1. Group by Catalog: This will display all the metrics data related to the selected catalog.
2. Group by Import Channel: This will compare the metrics related to the import channels linked to the selected catalog.
3. Group by Recommendation Model: This will compare the metrics related to the recommendation models linked to the selected catalog.

### Products

The products metrics tab contains data about how your website's users interact with your products. Without selecting a product, account-wide metrics data for all your products will be displayed on this tab. Selecting one product will restrict  the displayed metrics data to the selected one, and selecting more than one will generate a metrics comparison between the selected products.

These are the metrics available for products:

* Product Added to Cart Count: Number of times the selected product has been added to the cart.
* Product Order Count: Number of orders containing the selected product.
* Product Recommendation Count: Number of times the selected product was included in a recommendation.
* Product View Count: Number of times the selected product has been viewed.
* Recommendation Click Count: Number of times the selected product recommendation was clicked.
* Recommendation View Count: Number of times the selected product recommendation was viewed.

### Import Channels

The import channels metrics tab contains data about your importing jobs, such as data processing, performance, and failure rate. Without selecting an Import channel, account-wide metrics data for all your import channels will be displayed on this tab. Selecting one import channel will restrict the  displayed metrics data to the selected one, and selecting more than one will generate a metrics comparison between the selected ones.

These are the metrics available for import channels:

* Import Job Count: Number of Import Jobs started.

* Import Job Failure Rate: Percentage of jobs that have failed.
* Import Job Issues: Number of issues on the import jobs.
* Import Job Processed Bytes: Amount of bytes processed during the import jobs.
* Import Job Processed Records: Amount of records processed during the import jobs.

### Recommendation Models

The recommendation models metrics tab contains data about how your recommendation models are performing. Without selecting a recommendation model, account-wide metrics data for all your recommendation models will be displayed on this tab. Selecting one recommendation model will restrict the displayed metrics data to the selected one, and selecting more than one will generate a metrics comparison between the selected ones.

These are the metrics available for recommendation models:

* Product Recommendation Count: Number of times the selected product was included in a recommendation.
* Recommendation Click Count: Number of times the selected product recommendation was clicked.
* Recommendation Fulfillment Rate: Indicates if the recommendations are being fulfilled with products or if it's missing products.
* Recommendation Request Count: Number of times a recommendation was requested.
* Recommendation View Count: Number of times the selected product recommendation was viewed.
