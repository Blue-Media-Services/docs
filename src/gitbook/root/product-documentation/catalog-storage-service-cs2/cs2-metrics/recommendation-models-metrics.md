# Recommendation Models Metrics

{% hint style="info" %}
You can learn more about how metrics are handled by visiting the [Metrics page](../../metrics.md).&#x20;
{% endhint %}

This metrics tab contains data about the performance of your recommendation models. Without selecting a recommendation model, account-wide metrics for all your recommendation models will be displayed. Selecting one recommendation model will restrict the displayed metrics to that model. Selecting more than one will generate a comparison of metrics between the selected models.
