{% endhint %}

All features on CS2 have their own metrics tab, containing data about aspects related to each one, including performance and processing data.

### Catalog

The Catalog Metrics tab is a collection of all metrics available on all features of CS2. Initially, without selecting any catalog, a comparison between your catalogs will be displayed on this tab. Selecting more than one catalog will also show a comparison, this time between the selected catalogs. Picking only one catalog will enable the 'Group by' feature.

There are 3 options available on the 'Group by' feature:

1. Group by Catalog: This will display all the metrics data related to the selected catalog.
2. Group by Import Channel: This will compare the metrics related to the import channels linked to the selected catalog.
3. Group by Recommendation Model: This will compare the metrics related to the recommendation models linked to the selected catalog.
