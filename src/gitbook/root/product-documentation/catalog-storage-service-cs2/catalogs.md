# Catalogs

In the Catalogs tab, you will be able to create a catalog, and then install a pixel to your page so that BMS can collect data from your page based on the following events:

* Product Viewed
* Product Added to Cart
* Product Ordered

By adding those events to your page, we will be able to collect all the data needed to start creating metrics and then use our R**ecommendation Models** to improve your ads.

### Creating a Catalog

### Install Instructions

In order to activate our metrics and events, it is required to install a pixel to your website to start collecting data.

Select a Catalog you want to install your pixels and then move to the Install Instructions Tab.

Each event has a correct page to have your pixel installed, check on each event description to know exactly where.

Note: Every website has its own way of defining an offerID, so pay attention to how each product is tagged in yours, if you do not use the correct tag for your products, the event **will not work**.

_Example: Product ordered event should be installed on your **order confirmation page**._
