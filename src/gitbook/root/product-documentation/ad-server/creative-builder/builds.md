# Builds

Create builds based on your blueprints to generate dynamic banners for your campaigns. Dynamic banners are useful because they can customize what each user sees according to the parameters set, allowing for more engaging campaigns and improving expected results. For example, when running a retargeting campaign, you can create a build to generate creatives based on recommendation models, which will suggest products from your catalog based on the recent activity on your website, thereby improving your conversions.

## Managing Builds

### Creating Builds

Before creating a build,  it is necessary to create your blueprints. If you haven't done this yet, follow the instructions on the [Blueprints page](../../ad-serving/creative-builder/blueprints.md) and then come back.

1.  Click on <img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (159) (1).png" alt="" data-size="line"> to start creating your Build.\

2. Fill in the details:
   * Name: Set a name for your Build.
   * Tags: Set tags for your organization.
   * Domain: Select the domain to which you want to redirect the user when he clicks on the ad.
   * Blueprint: Select the previously configured blueprint to start configuring its parameters.
   * Generated sizes: Select in which sizes your ads' banners should be generated.
   * Parameters: This section will change according to the selected blueprint, it will contain the same parameters configured on the blueprint, you can adjust these parameters as you observe a preview of how your dynamic banners are being generated.
3. Click on <img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (161) (1).png" alt="" data-size="line"> to save your Build.

### Previewing Banners

The creatives tab shows you a preview of how dynamic banners are being generated by your builds.

To see a preview on the creatives tab, select at least one build from the build list by checking the box on the left side of the build's name. Selecting more than one will show you a preview of all the selected builds.

### Editing, Archiving and Deleting Builds

It's possible to edit your builds by clicking on <img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (165).png" alt="" data-size="line"> at the same row as the build you need to edit. Except for the domain, all parameters and details are available for edition.

You can also duplicate builds by clicking on <img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (166).png" alt="" data-size="line"> at the same row as the build you need to duplicate. This is useful if you want to create a build that changes only a few details compared to an existing one while keeping the original.

Archiving builds is an option that helps you organize your builds better. To archive a build, click on <img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (167).png" alt="" data-size="line"> at the same row as the build you need to archive. To visualize your archived builds, turn on the archived option above the builds list.

You can delete builds as well, this can be done by clicking on ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (168).png>) at the same row as the build you need to delete, selecting what should be done with the creatives generated by the build, and then clicking on <img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (169).png" alt="" data-size="line"> to confirm the action.
