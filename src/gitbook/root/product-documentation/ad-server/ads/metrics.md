Once you have created your ads and started a campaign, you will be able to check your metrics and analyze your ads performance, providing you with precise data.

Since the group by feature is available for this metrics tab you will also be able to Group your metrics by:

* Ad - See the performance of each ad separately
* Rule - Check which rule is working better for your ads, making it easy to make adjustments
* Creative Group - Be able to see which creative group is performing better and create strategies.
* Exchange - Check the performance of an AdExchange and make adjustments on top of that data.

Each Group by option may present different metrics, related only to that option you have chosen.
