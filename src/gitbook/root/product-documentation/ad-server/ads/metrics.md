# Metrics

Once you have created your ads and started a campaign, you will be able to check your metrics and analyze your ads performance, providing you with precise data.

* Data Table: This option will bring the same data that are on the metric cards in table format. This visualization option allows you to export the data by clicking on the download button <img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (125).png" alt="" data-size="line">.  You can also visualize the table in full-screen mode by clicking on ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (126).png>).

## Time-Frames and Periodicity

One of the features on the metrics tab is defining a time frame and a period in which you want to visualize your metrics.

</div>

We can select a time frame to visualize the performance of any product's features within that period. To define a time frame, click on the button that represents the desired period or use the calendar button to set a custom time frame.

Additionally, it's also possible to set a period to define measurement intervals. For example, suppose you select a time frame of 1 day and a period of 1 hour. In that case, all the results from the last day will be displayed and divided into 1 hour periods.

To update your results click on the refresh button <img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (122).png" alt="" data-size="original">.

You will also be able to Group your metrics by:

* Ad - See the performance of each ad separately
* Rule - Check which rule is working better for your ads, making it easy to make adjustments
* Creative Group - Be able to see which creative group is performing better and create strategies.
* Exchange - Check the performance of an AdExchange and make adjustments on top of that data.

Each Group by option may present different metrics, related only to that option you have chosen.
