# Ad Exchange Review

Some ad exchanges require a review of your ad before displaying it in their inventory to ensure compliance with their pre-established rules. Once the review is complete, the ad exchange will inform you whether the ad is approved or rejected, along with the reason for rejection.&#x20;

Reviewing ads is essential to prevent inappropriate content from being displayed on websites that do not accept such content.&#x20;

Please note that sometimes an ad exchange's rejection might not provide an accurate status for your review. Therefore, make sure to resend your ad for review to double-check the rejection status.
