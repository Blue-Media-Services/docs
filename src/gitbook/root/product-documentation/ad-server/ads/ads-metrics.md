# Ads Metrics

{% hint style="info" %}
You can learn more about how metrics are handled by visiting the [Metrics page](../../metrics.md).&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Once you have created your ads and started a campaign, you will be able to check your metrics and analyze your ads performance, providing you with precise data.

Since the group by feature is available for this metrics tab you will also be able to Group your metrics by:

* Ad - See the performance of each ad separately.
* Rule - Check which rule is working better for your ads, making it easy to make adjustments.
* Creative Group - See which creative group is performing better and create strategies accordingly.
* Exchange - Check the performance of an AdExchange and make adjustments based on that data.

Each Group by option may present different metrics related only to your chosen option.

* **Budget Spent**: Represents the total budget spent, including media purchases, ad delivery, and bidding activities. This is the overall cost of running your campaign. The campaign is not just based on its bid price, which was established when the campaign was created.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (3) (9).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Budget Spent Metric</p></figcaption></figure>

> Example: In this metric, you can see that the budget spent per ad has not reached $1.00 since you established our bid pricing below $1.00. If you make any changes during the campaign, the metric will reflect those changes.

* **Bids & Bid Win %**: This represents the number of bids placed on auction. It does not mean you have won the auction, only that you placed a bid based on your bid pricing. The ratio of successful bids to total bids placed is an important metric, as it will be decisive for knowing when to raise your bid price or change your strategy. This metric will help you understand how many bids you win.

</div>

> Example: The graph shows the volume of bids in a campaign over six days (June 10-16). The number of bids varies considerably, with the peak on June 11th (2,000 bids) and the lowest number on June 14th (less than 500 bids). On June 16th, the highest bid and the lowest bid are equal. You can see from these metrics that not all bids were successful<mark style="color:purple;">.</mark> By making strategic changes based on bid pricing and targets, you can reach a higher win rate. It may be that the audience you were targeting is more expensive than the bid set.

* **Impression**s: After winning a bid, you earn the right to publish the ad on the domain where you placed the bid. An impression is based on a user having your ad downloaded on the domain's page.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (7) (8).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Impressions Metric</p></figcaption></figure>

> Example: The graph shows the volume of impressions during a period of six days (June 10-16). There was a peak of nearly 700 impressions on June 11th. Once you start your campaign, if your bids are successful, you will begin to receive impressions based on winning bids. A campaign focused on branding aims to get as many impressions as possible, since your goal is to reach a larger public.

* **Impression Price**: The prices paid on successful bids. Know exactly how much you are paying for a successful bid.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (8) (8).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Impression Price Metric</p></figcaption></figure>

> Example: It is useful to know when the impression is getting expensive. In this metric, you can see that the impression price has met $2.00. This can happen when the targets are not broad enough, causing you to spend more budget to get 1000 impressions. Make adjustments based on your campaign's objective. If you are targeting a more specific audience, your impression price might be a bit high.

* **CPM**: This is the cost per every 1000 impressions. It can serve as a baseline to know whether your campaign is reaching the targeted CPM. Based on your CPM strategy, note that the CPM is not the total cost of your campaign. For that, you will have to check your Budget Spent Metric.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (9) (8).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>CPM Metric</p></figcaption></figure>

> Example: In this graph, you can see that the CPM has reached over $3.50 due to a change of targets. If there is a very specific audience targeted, you may need to spend a bit more to win bids on disputed domains. If you start a branding campaign focused on reaching a maximum of $4.00 per 1000 impressions, you will need to check if your campaign is getting enough bid wins to generate impressions. Make the necessary changes, such as slightly adjusting your targets or increasing your bidding price.

* **Deliveries & Delivery %**: This metric represents the number of ads served from the Ad Server, based on the end user's browser requesting the content. This means your ad will be in the user's browser.

<div>

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (10) (8).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Deliveries Metric</p></figcaption></figure>

 

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (11) (8).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Deliveries % Metric</p></figcaption></figure>

</div>

> Example: In this graph, you can see that a peak of almost 700 deliveries was reached, with an average delivery rate of 100%. This means your ads are being delivered to the correct audience without any restrictions on their domain. The Delivery metric is often related to the Impressions metric. After winning a bid, your ad will be served to the domain. However, if your delivery does not get a similar result as the impressions, it may be caused by the domain's rules, towards blocking some specific kind of Ads.

* **Displays & Display %**: This metric represents the number of ads displayed in a browser. It indicates that the ad has been downloaded and shown to the user's browser.

<div>

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (12) (8).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Displays Metric</p></figcaption></figure>

 

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (13) (8).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Display % Metric</p></figcaption></figure>

</div>

> Example: In this graph, you can see that a peak of nearly 650 Displays was reached. Even though your impression numbers are a bit higher, the display rate is not reaching 100%. This can be caused by the ad not being positioned well enough, causing the user to not see the ad for even a fraction of their browsing routine. Making changes to the positioning and making the creative more attractive can increase the display rate of your ads.

* **Views**: Number of views according to the **Media Ratings Council Guidelines**, 50% of the ad must be on screen for at least 1 second. This metric is only validated once the user meets the **MRCG** requirements.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (160).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Views Metric</p></figcaption></figure>

> Example: In this graph, you reached a peak of nearly 400 Views on June 11th. If the views are close to the delivery and display numbers, you can analyze that your Ad is attractive and is achieving a branding result, since people are effectively seeing your ad. The ad must be displayed in the user's browser, and the user needs to see at least 50% of the ad for at least 1 second.  If only  40% of the ad is shown, it will not count as a view.

* **Viewability**: The ratio of views to the total number of deliveries. It is an important metric to measure if your ads are being viewed. Based on this, you might need to change your campaign's strategy.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (161).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Viewability Metric</p></figcaption></figure>

> Example: You can see in this graph that the campaign started with an average viewability of 50% to 80% , and after some changes, reached a peak at 100% viewability. If your ads are not being viewed, you might need to check your creative and make changes, or even change the positioning of your ads to make them more visible. Keep in mind that changing the positioning can also increase the bidding price due to the spot being more competitive.

* **Clicks & CTR**: Number of clicks. If your campaign's strategy is based on clicks, pay attention to this metric and make the necessary adjustments.

<div>

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (17) (8).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Clicks Metric</p></figcaption></figure>

 

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (20) (6).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>CTR Metric</p></figcaption></figure>

</div>

> Example: In this graph, you can see that we reached a peak of nearly 10 clicks on certain Ads. You can analyze this graph to check which Ads are not being clicked as expected and see what they have different from the Ads that have been clicked. A campaign based on Retargeting or Remarketing is focused on clicks to drive conversions. To achieve this, you need to create attractive creatives and may need to allocate a larger budget to secure better positioning and target more specific audiences.

* **CPC**: This metric represents the budget spent for each click. Many campaigns prioritize clicks, and CPC indicates the cost per click. If your campaign emphasizes clicks, it's essential to monitor both the CPC and the Budget Spent metric to determine the overall effectiveness and cost efficiency of your campaign.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (21) (4).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>CPC Metric</p></figcaption></figure>

> Example: In this metric, you can observe that the cost per click varies for each ad, reaching a maximum of nearly $1.30. This fluctuation may be influenced by factors such as when the ad is displayed, the time window you are targeting, and whether the creative is compelling to your intended audience.

* **Time to Display**: This metric measures the time it takes for the ad to load and be displayed. If your ad is too heavy, it might encounter difficulties loading on weaker devices or slower internet connections.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (22) (4).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Time to Display Metric</p></figcaption></figure>

> Example: You can see on this graph that some ads are on average taking over 3 seconds to load. If your ad is heavier or close to 2 MB, some users may experience longer loading times, resulting in delays before your ad appears. This can impact directly the visibility of your ad, potentially causing users to miss it during their browsing activities, optimizing your creative might help.

* **Time to View**: This metric measures the time it takes for a user to view the ad. By examining this metric, you can assess whether adjustments are needed regarding the placement of your ad. If users are taking too long to view your ad, it might be poorly positioned.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (23) (4).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Time to View Metric</p></figcaption></figure>

> Example: In this metric, you can see that at the beginning of the campaign, the ads were being viewed much more quickly, largely due to their positioning. However, after some changes, the ads were taking significantly longer than intended, often extending beyond an additional 15 to 20 seconds. An ad displayed at the top of a page is much more visible than one on a side panel, which may require scrolling to view. As a result, changing the positioning of your ad will directly impact the time it takes for users to view it.

* **Time to Click**: This metric measures the time it takes for a user to click on the ad. If users take too long to click, it could indicate that the ad is misplaced or not as attractive as expected. Consider making changes to enhance the attractiveness of your ad or adjusting its positioning.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (24) (4).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Time to Click Metric</p></figcaption></figure>

> Example: In this metric, you can observe that, on average, users take 1 minute and 30 seconds before clicking on an ad. If the ad is taking too long to be clicked, you should pay attention to the quality of your creative. It might be better to identify areas for improvement. Additionally, you can also use A/B Tests to assess the performance of each Ad and make multiple improvements in each test to reach a final version of that creative that get more results. Keep monitoring your ads and make constant adjustments.

* **Bid Price Effective**: This metric indicates the prices placed on bids and shows how much you are actually paying on each auction. You can make adjustments to spend less or more budget based on how much you are paying if you are using our variable bid pricing. You can check how our intelligent bidding is affecting your costs.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (25) (4).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Bid Price Effective Metric</p></figcaption></figure>

> Example: You can see on this graph that the average bid price ranged from $0.50 to $1.00. When placing bids on uncontested domains, you are likely to pay an average or even the minimum price for the auction, rather than the maximum. However, in highly contested domains, you may need to increase your bid or pay close to the maximum. This is largely influenced by the current price of the auction. In this metric, we observed that at some points, we encountered domains or target configurations that required higher bid prices, resulting in an increase of nearly $1.00.

* **Budget Spent on Impressions**: This metric represents the total budget spent on media purchases and reflects the expenses incurred for acquiring ad spaces.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (26) (4).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Budget Spent on Impressions Metric</p></figcaption></figure>

> Example: In this graph, you can see that the budget spent was a little high. However, after making adjustments on the targets, you reached a better average of over $0.75. It is important to know exactly how much you are spending on impressions, to optimize your budget effectively. Impressions are crucial for branding campaigns, as they help reach a wider audience or convey important messages.

* **Budget Spent on Deliveries**: This metric indicates the total budget spent on the ad delivery process, including the costs associated with distributing ads to the target audience.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (27) (4).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Budget Spent on Deliveries Metric</p></figcaption></figure>

> Example: In this graph, you can see that the average reached was between $0.15 to $0.35. It is important to understand the amount you are spending on deliveries, which is measured by the sum of impressions, deliveries, displays, and views. This will assist you in determining whether the deliveries are meeting your campaign's objectives and enable you to make necessary adjustments.
