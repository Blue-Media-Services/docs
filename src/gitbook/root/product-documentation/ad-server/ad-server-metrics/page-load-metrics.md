# Page Load Metrics

{% hint style="info" %}
You can learn more about how metrics are handled by visiting the [Metrics page](../../metrics.md).&#x20;
{% endhint %}

The page load metrics contain data about how your ads are performing when clicked, specifically about your website's page load, how much time it takes for your page to be loaded after a user clicks on your ads, how much each page loaded costs you and how many times your website's page has been load,  you can access these metrics on the metrics tab of Campaigns or any Ad Server features.

### Page Loads

This metric displays the number of page loads you had in the defined time frame. The number of clicks and page loads may differ because clicks pass through an anti-fraud filter. A click might be flagged as suspicious and not counted, however, if the page loads up to 15 minutes after the ad delivery, the page load will be counted.

_**Example**: This is a more precise way to count how many users visited your page by clicking on your ads, the user will only be counted after loading your page completely. In this picture, the defined time frame was 3 days, divided into 6-hour periods, you will notice that on Aug 21 there were nearly 25 page loads and nearly 5 page loads on Aug 23._

### Page Load Rate (%)

This metric shows the ratio of pages loaded to ad delivery, which means that it shows, in percentage, how much of your ad deliveries resulted in a page load.

_**Example**: In a context where you install the page load tracking tag on your website, you will be able to follow on this metric how much of your ad deliveries resulted in users accessing your website. In this picture, the defined time frame was 3 days, divided into 6-hour periods, you will notice that on Aug 21 nearly 0.75% of the ad deliveries resulted in a page load, and after that, on Aug 23, the page load rate was almost 0.25%._

### Cost Per Page Load

This metric shows a median of how much of your budget has been spent for each page loaded.

_**Example**: After installing the page loading tracking tag, this metric will show you a median of how much each page load has cost you in the defined time frame. In this picture, the defined time frame was 3 days, divided into 6-hour periods, you will notice that on Aug 21, at 12:00 PM the average cost per page load was nearly $1.60, this was the maximum cost on the period, after that there is an oscillation that stays between $0.50 and $1.50._

### Time To Page Load

This metric shows a median in seconds of how much time was taken until your website's page was fully loaded.

_**Example**: These metrics provide information on how much time it takes until your page loads, you can use this data to improve your ads and your website to be faster, which can improve your retention rate. In this picture, the defined time frame was 3 days, divided into 6-hour periods, you will notice that on Aug 21, the time to load the page was nearly 10 seconds, after that, this time was reduced to nearly 5 seconds and then increased to a little more than 10 seconds on Aug 23._

### Click to Page Load Rate

This metric displays, in percentage, the ratio between the number of clicks and the number of page loads in the defined time frame.

_**Example**: The data provided by this metric will show you how many clicks on your ads have resulted in a page load. In this picture, the defined time frame was 1 day divided into 6h periods, you will notice that at 6 AM the click to page load rate was nearly 80%, meaning that 20% of the clicks didn't result in a page load, from noon until 6 PM the click to page load rate was nearly 60%, after that it increases at midnight to 100%, meaning every ad click resulted in a page load._&#x20;
