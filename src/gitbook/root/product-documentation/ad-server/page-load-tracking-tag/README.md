Once you add this tag to your website, it begins tracking the entire journey from when a user clicks on your ad to when your webpage fully loads. It records the time taken for this process and gathers crucial metrics, such as the total number of page loads, the conversion rate of clicks to page loads, the average cost per page load, and the average time from click to page load.
