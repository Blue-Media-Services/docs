Trackers and Cookie Pools have their own metrics tab, bringing us data about their performance and behavior.

## Cookie Pools

Select a cookie pool on the list to access its metrics, it's also possible to select more than one to compare their results between them.

Each card contains relevant data about your cookie pools:

* Expiration Count: The amount of cookies that expired.
* Max Size: Maximum amount of cookies allowed in the pool.
* Size: The amount of cookies inside the pool.
* Sync Count: The amount of cookies synchronizations.
* Time Until Expiration: The amount of time a cookie will be available in the pool before expiring.

## Trackers

To access the metrics tab select the trackers which you want to visualize data on the trackers' list:

We can select more than one tracker, however, the option 'Group by' is only available when selecting only one tracker, when selecting more than one tracker, the data will be grouped by tracker and this option won't be displayed.

### Grouping by Tracker

When grouping by tracker all the data collected by the selected tracker will be displayed on these metric cards or data table columns:

* Action Execution Count: Number of times an action was executed.
* Action Failure Rate: The rate of action failures.
* Expiration Count: The number of user expirations.
* Maximum Users: Maximum number of users to be added to the tracker.
* New Activities: Number of new activities tracked.
* Time Until Expiration: The amount of time the users tracked remains available before expiring.
* Tracker User Count: The number of users tracked.

### Grouping by Event&#x20;
