# Cookie Pools

A Cookie Pool is a collection or database of users' cookies. Cookies are tiny pieces of data stored in a user's web browser when they visit a website. These cookies record users' online behavior, preferences, and interactions with websites and services.

In the context of digital advertising and marketing, a cookie pool can serve several purposes:

* **Audience Segmentation:** Segment users into different groups based on their interests, behaviors, demographics, or other criteria. This segmentation allows for more targeted and customized advertising campaigns.
* **Retargeting:** Collect users' data based on events and actions for tracking purposes, this data can be used later to create recommendation models for your retargeting campaigns, improving your conversions. [Learn more about Retargeting campaigns](../../solutions/retargeting.md).
* **Ad Customization:** Use the data gathered to display more relevant ads for each user on your target, based on their recent online activity, interests and behavior, customized ads are more engaging and lead the advertiser to get better results.
* **Analytics and Measurement:** Track your campaigns' performance, measuring click-through rates, conversion rates and user engagement, among other metrics.
* **Frequency Capping:** Set frequency caps to limit how often a particular ad is shown to a user within a certain time frame. This prevents displaying the same ad to the same user repeatedly.

[^1]: Aqui, antes de iniciar as etapas, colocar esse textinho: Attention, please! The cookie pool needs to be created shortly before activating a campaign so that it can be populated. In this space, you can configure the duration for which cookies will remain available in the pool, determine the maximum number of cookies in the pool, and also define the AdExchange from which we will use your cookies to retarget users. The cookie pool can be used in campaigns from any domain, but always within the same account. It's important to mention that no sensitive user data is collected at this stage.

[^2]: Acrescentaria: After the maximum cookie limit is reached, no further cookies will be added to the cookie pool. To continue compiling your cookies, you can edit the Cookie Pool and increase the "Max Size".

    Keep in mind: the cost of this technology depends on the number of stored cookies.
