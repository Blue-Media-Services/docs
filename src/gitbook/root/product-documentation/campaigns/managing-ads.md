### Checking your Ad Status

If your ad has been recently created, it might have a <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (16) (2).png" alt="Issue Sign" data-size="line"> sign, it can be related to not having a rule configured or pending approvals on Ad Exchanges. You can check what is the issue by hovering the cursor over the warning sign.

### Deleting an Ad

If an ad has been mistakenly added or is no longer useful for that campaign, you can delete it from your campaign by clicking on <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (47).png" alt="Delete Ad" data-size="line">, a confirming screen will be shown.&#x20;

Note that deleting an ad from your campaign cannot be undone, so if you remove the incorrect ad, you will have to manually add it again.
