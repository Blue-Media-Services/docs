# Managing Targets

After creating a Campaign, you will be required to set one Target at least to run the campaign, targets are basically which kind of public you want your campaign to be displayed to, our targets work using **AND** rules not **OR**, so whenever you include a target, you will be restricting your campaign even more to your desired public.

If you set your campaign with broader targets, your budget will be spent more rapidly, since you will be receiving bid requests from a large range of publishers.

### Pre-Targets

These are the targets that will work as the first filter (Location, Cookie Pools, Exchange) and will exclude other possibilities.&#x20;

Example: If your objective is to target a specific audience from a Cookie Pool, your ads will only be shown to those users inside the Cookie Pool, disregarding other users.

### Targets

You can choose who to show ads to based on where these users are located by either specifying the country and region or by adding geofences around specific addresses.

* **Location**
  * Geographies - By selecting specific countries or regions, your ads will only appear to users accessing from those geographic locations.
  * Geo-fences - By selecting specific countries or regions, your ads will only appear to users accessing from those geographic locations.
* **Contents**
  * Languages - By including a particular language, your ads will only appear on websites in that language.
  * Categories - By including specific categories, your ads will only appear on websites featuring content in those categories.
  * Domains - By including specific domains, your ads will only appear on those specified websites.
  * URL Keywords - By defining URL keywords, you can refine where your ads appear based on the URL's content.
* **Device**
  * Operational Systems - By selecting specific operating systems, your ads will be displayed to users navigating the web on those systems.
  * Browsers - By selecting specific browsers, your ads will be displayed to users navigating the web through those browsers.
  * Device Types - By selecting specific device types, your ads will be displayed to users navigating the web on those devices.
  * Visited URL Keywords / Domains - By defining Visited URL Keywords / Domains, you're tailoring which devices will see your ads based on their recent navigation history. We track the URLs that a device has accessed within the past 24 hours.
  * Cookie Pools - By selecting specific cookie pools, your ads will target only the users who have been added to those selected pools.
* **Inventory**
  * Exchange - By selecting specific ad exchanges, your ads will be displayed through those platforms.
  * Position - Select specific inventory positions to strategically place your ads for optimal visibility and engagement.
  * \*Viewability - Adjust the slider to set the minimum viewability threshold for ad slots. Your ads will only be matched with inventory positions where the viewability percentage is higher than the selected threshold. This allows for precise control over ad placement, ensuring your ads are only displayed in slots with a visibility level that meets or exceeds your criteria for optimal engagement and impact. \
    \*This target option is in beta and currently is only supported by Google Authorized Buyers.

For a campaign to star and to use your configured target, you must have a target enabled. If you wish to change the target or simply stop using a specific target, you can disable it and the campaign will stop using that target immediately.
