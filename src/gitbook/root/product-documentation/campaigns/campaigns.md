# Managing Campaigns

### Creating a Campaign

In the Campaigns Area click on the <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (10) (3).png" alt="Create Campaign" data-size="line"> Button.

Fill in the details.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (11) (3).png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption><p>Campaign Creation Screen</p></figcaption></figure>

* Name - Choose a name for your campaign;
* Tags - up to 5 labels that can be used to aid identification and searching;
* Domain - this is the primary domain that this campaign will take the user when clicked;
* Time Zone – which time zone you want to deliver your campaign;
* Scheduling - set your start and ending date for the Campaign;
* Bid Price – this is where you will be deciding your bidding price for the AD’s auction;
  * Fixed - Set your immutable price for an inventory slot;
  * Variable - Activate this option to use our technology "**Bid Shading**", which is the platform's own bidder; if activated, it will optimize your budget spend, always focusing on the fairest value for purchasing those inventory spaces. This generates significant savings, although the company may choose not to activate Bid Shading and let the bidding offer be based solely on the CPM target.
* Frequency Cap: Amount of impressions per device, here you can change how many times the campaign will be shown to each device;

{% hint style="warning" %}
_Attention! The higher the Frequency Cap, the more you'll appear to the same user. The lower the Frequency Cap, you'll reach more users and appear less often to each of them._
{% endhint %}

* QPS: Amount of bid requests your campaign will be sending per second.

After filling all fields, click on the <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (14).png" alt="Save" data-size="line"> button, if there is any invalid field, it will be shown so you can review what is missing.

This will be your view after successfully creating a campaign.

Configure your [Budget](budgets.md), [Targets](targets.md) and [Ads](managing-ads.md).

### Enabling your Campaign

In order to enable your campaign, you **must** have at least one Target and Ad added to the campaign, you can also check the <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (76).png" alt="" data-size="line"> sign to see whether there is any issue preventing you from enabling the campaign.

Note: If this notice appears in the status of your creative, ad, or campaign, it means that the material was not approved by the platform or ad exchanges. In this case, BMS will inform you of the issue in question (in detail) by hovering the cursor on the sign, and you can make the necessary adjustments before activation.

{% hint style="warning" %}
_Attention! We always advise to deactivate the campaign instead of deleting it completely. When deleting a campaign, all data and metrics are lost as well._
{% endhint %}

### Metrics

While real-time events are kept for 15 minutes, you can check the campaign metrics for any time interval. Metrics can take up to 5 minutes to display the most recent data.

In the metrics tab you can explore several metrics, grouping values by specific fields, change visualization between charts and tables, change time range and download the data to analyze it in your own device.

**Most relevant metrics**

* Budget Spent - indicates how your budget is being spent over time.
* Impressions and CPM - indicates how many impressions are being made and what is the Cost per Mille.
* Viewability - indicates the percentage of impressions that are actually being seen.
* Clicks and CPC - indicates how many clicks are being made and the Cost-Per-Click.

**Grouping options**

* Campaign: Good to compare the performance of multiple campaigns.
* Ad: Check which Ad is performing better and make adjustments or remove them.
* Target: Be able to see how your targets are performing and which of them can be improved or disabled.
* Exchange: Get to know how the exchange is behaving and which is worth your spending your budget in.

**Visualization options**

* Metric Cards: This manner is an easier way to view your metrics and compare them with others since they will be showing you a graphic and pointing to each group chosen.
* Data Table: By selecting this visualization method, you can either check on your screen the data requested or download it as .csv and then make your own filters and work with the values shown. To download it simply select the visualization method and then click on ![Download CSV](https://docs.bluems.com/\~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F2773629451-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252FhY34GDQYan7GqviubCLT%252Fuploads%252FXG9nhYgglIIxtHZhC0Wb%252Fimage.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3Df73a080c-878b-4d94-b04e-ee2820289c86\&width=45\&dpr=4\&quality=100\&sign=41fab3d3d38e3aa19106157d140e55c4a7cf0b11d34a32d901b358cf2216395f) to start downloading your metrics.

In every metric you will have a <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (38).png" alt="Info" data-size="line"> which will precisely explain what that metric represents.

You can also **monitor** your campaign through our <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (32).png" alt="Overview" data-size="line"> tab [here](monitoring-campaigns.md).
