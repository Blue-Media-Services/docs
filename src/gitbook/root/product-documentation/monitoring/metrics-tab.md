# Metrics Tab

All BMS resources have monitoring metrics associated with them. These metrics can be visually inspected on the corresponding Metrics Tabs such as this:

You can select up to 10 resources to compare the metrics between them. If there are no resources selected you will be presented with the metrics for the whole account. You can change the period you wish to see: 1 hour, 3 hours, 12 hours, 1 day, 3 days, 1 week or custom dates.

Each metric card has a title, an inline tip with the metric description, the statistic being used (in this example "avg") and the unit for the measurement (in this example "$/1000").

You can click on any metric card and see an expanded version with more details:

Here you have the option to change the statistic used (for metrics that support multiple statistics), change the granularity (1 min, 5 min, 10 min, 15 min, 30 min, 1 hour, 6 hour or 1 day) or change the period (1 hour, 3 hours, 12 hours, 1 day, 3 days, 1 week or custom dates).

There is also a download button that will export this chart as a CSV file that can be loaded into a spreadsheet or another tool for analysis.
