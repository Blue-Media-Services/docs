# Metrics

{% hint style="info" %}
To learn more about how the metrics service works, how to set your visualization options, and how to download your data, visit our [Metrics page](../metrics.md).&#x20;
{% endhint %}

All of our products have metrics in order to provide you with all the information we have once the product is being used.

## Event Stores

Once you start using our event stores, you will be able to check the metrics related to download data.

You can also check your metrics grouping by **Type**, to separate your data by each event pipe's event.

## Event Pipes

Once an event pipe is enabled and actions related to that event pipe are happening, the metrics will start updating.

You can group your metrics by Event Pipes, being able to compare your events and check how many events were matched.

You can also check each event pipe's target metrics, by grouping your metrics by **Targets**.

* Call Count - The number of times a target has been called for execution within the event pipe.
* Failure Rate - The ratio of failed execution attempts on a target within an event pipe.

When checking Metrics, you can always check our <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (28) (2).png" alt="Information" data-size="line"> to receive more detailed information on how a specific metric works.
