# Metrics

The main BMS products include a metrics tab. These metrics are invaluable for monitoring your campaigns' results and gathering insights about your target audience. By understanding their behaviors and preferences, you can tailor your campaigns more effectively. This deeper audience knowledge enables you to create better campaigns in the future, thereby enhancing your results and increasing brand engagement.

Additionally, metrics are essential for managing your expenses on the platform. They provide a clear view of your investments, ensuring that your budget is utilized efficiently and optimized to achieve your desired outcomes. By keeping a close eye on these metrics, you can make informed decisions and adjust your strategies to maximize the return on your marketing efforts.

## Time Frame and Periodicity

This feature of the metrics' tabs allows you to define a time frame and a period for visualizing the data collected in this time frame.&#x20;

We can select a time frame to visualize the data gathered by the utilized services within that period. To define a time frame, click on the button that represents the desired period or use the calendar button to set a custom time frame.

Additionally, it's also possible to set a period to define measurement intervals. For example, suppose you select a time frame of 1 day and a period of 1 hour. In that case, all the results from the last day will be displayed and divided into 1 hour periods.

To update your results click on the refresh button <img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (122).png" alt="" data-size="original">.
