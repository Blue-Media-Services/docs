### Media Library Management

In the media section, all charges are related to downloading and storage. Any media downloaded to the end user's browser, including media you download, will count as a download request. This request will incur charges based on the bytes transferred during the download. Additionally, stored media will be charged on a 720-hour basis, according to the amount of media stored per hour and the bytes consumed per hour.

_**Example:**_ _On this bill, it is noted that the media has been downloaded 5,130,054 times, resulting in a charge of $51.30. The total data transferred from all these requests amounted to 142.175 GB, leading to an additional charge of $142.18. Media storage costs were minimal, at $0.06, due to a small number of media files in the library and a short storage duration. After summing all the charges, the total amount is $193.54._
