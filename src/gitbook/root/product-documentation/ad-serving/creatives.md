# Creatives

In the Creatives area, you can create the creatives that will be used in your campaign. With a pre-approval from BMS, you'll know if your creative is following Ad Exchanges' best practices before sending your campaign for approval.

## Managing Creatives

### Creating a Creative

1. In the Creatives page, click on the "**+ CREATIVE**" button.
2. Fill in the details:
   * Name - how you want to call this creative;
   * Tags - up to 5 labels that can be used to aid identification and searching;
   * Domain - this is the primary domain that this creative will take the user when clicked;
   * Type - the type of creative, can be any common IAB size like "Large Leaderboard (970x90)", "Banner (468x60)", etc.
3. To design your creative you have two options:
   * To use a simple image with a link, on the "Static Image" tab, fill:
     * The image you want to display. You can paste an URL for an image you are already hosting or you can use the integration with the BMS Media Library to find or upload a new one.
       * The BMS Media Library supports uploads of static images or GIFs as long as the file size is 2 MB or less.
     * The link you want to open when the image is clicked. You can use any https URL with any query strings such as UTMs. We will add our standard click tracker to be able to show metrics for the creative.
   * To use a fully customized creative, switch to the "Paste HTML" tab and add the final HTML code that be displayed when the user sees your creative.
     * This can be anything and it is entirely up to you to produce a working creative with HTML, CSS and Javascript.
     * When you provide the HTML code, we will not automatically add our click tracker. You can copy the click tracker macro (or any other macro you wish) from the bottom template assist buttons and paste it on your HTML.
4. You can use the "Preview" button to check how your creative will be displayed and to make sure that it goes to the correct site when clicking on it.
5. If you are ready to send the creative for review ensure that the "Send for review" option is checked. If you wish to continue editing it later, leave it unchecked.
6. In the end, just save it.

### Editing a Creative

When editing a creative all options remain available except the domain selection. Once created you cannot change the domain for a creative.

If you modify the image URL, link or the HTML code the creative will go back to the "Draft" status and you will need to send the creative for review again. While in draft the creative will not be shown on any campaigns.

### Enabling and Disabling a Creative

To be displayed in a campaign a creative must be enabled. If you wish to prevent a creative from being displayed you can disable it and it will immediately cease impressions.

### Archiving and Unarchiving a Creative

Creatives that are not being used as often can be archived. Archiving a creative does not prevent it from being used or displayed, just hides it from main view.

To see all archived creatives simply turn on the "Archived" filter. You can unarchive a creative to make it show again on the main list.

### Deleting a Creative

You can delete a creative at any point in time. If the creative is being used, you will be presented with a list of creative groups that will be affected. If you confirm the deletion, the creative groups will be modified to remove the deleted creative from rotation.

## Review Process

All creatives are reviewed to ensure that they comply with our policies and the policies for our partners.

The review process is usually very quick. If there is any issue it will be displayed as "Rejected" with a tooltip indicating what the reason was. You can make the necessary changes and submit it for review again.

A creative will only receive impressions if it is enabled by you and approved by BMS.
