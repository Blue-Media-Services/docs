# Creatives

In the Creatives area, you can create the creatives that will be used in your campaign. With a pre-approval from BMS, you'll know if your creative is following Ad Exchanges' best practices before sending your campaign for approval.

## <mark style="color:blue;">Creating a creative</mark>

1. In the Creatives page, click on the "**+ CREATIVE**" button.
2. Fill in the details
   * Name - how you want to call this creative
   * Tags
   * Domain - this is the primary domain that this creative will take the user when clicked
   * Link to - where you set the parameters for your campaign (UTMâ€™s)
   * Type - the IAB dimensions
3. Now you can choose how to define your creative:
   * Using an image and a link, specify:
     * The image you want to display. You can select an image hosted in the media library or you can paste a URL for an image hosted elsewhere.
     * The link you want to open when the image is clicked. You can use any https URL. We will add our standard click tracker to be able to show metrics for the creative.
   *   Using pure html code

       * The raw html code that will be displayed when the user sees your creative.
       * This can be anything and it is entirely up to you.
       * In this case, we will not automatically add our click tracker. You can copy the click tracker macro (or any other macro you wish) from the bottom template assist buttons

       Types

       * Statics images
       * GIFs -  maximum size 2bm per image
