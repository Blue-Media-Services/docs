# Creative Group

In the Creative Groups area, you can create groups of creatives of the same format and size for A/B testing.

## <mark style="color:blue;">Creating a Creative Group</mark>

1. In the Creative Group page click at the "**+ CREATIVE GROUP**" button.
2. Fill the details:

* Name of your creative group;
* Internal tag for organization;
* Campaign domain;
* Choose the size of your banner;
* Add the creatives (with the same format and size) that you want to be part of your A/B test group;

3. You can choose the weight you want to give each creative.&#x20;

> **Note:** Remember that if the weight is the same, the platform will deliver the creatives equally, creating an A/B test. If you increase the weight, the platform will give preference to the creative with the highest weight.

4. Click "Preview" to see your group of creatives;
5. Save.
