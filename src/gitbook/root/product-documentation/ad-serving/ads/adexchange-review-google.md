## ADULT CONTENT

Explicit adult content is not allowed on the ad network. Some adult-oriented ads and landing pages are allowed but will show in limited scenarios based on user searches, user age, and local laws.

## DESTINATION NOT CRAWLABLE

Make sure Googlebot is allowed to crawl your landing page by checking your robots.txt file.

## ONLINE GAMBLING

The promotion of online, real-money gambling or sites that contain or link to content related to online gambling is allowed with country-specific restrictions.

## SHOCKING CONTENT

Remove content that contains violent language, gruesome imagery, graphic images, accounts of physical trauma, and obscene or profane language likely to shock or scare.
