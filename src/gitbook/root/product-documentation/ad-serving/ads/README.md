# Ads

In the Ads area you will create the Ads for your campaign, adding the group of creatives you want to send to the AdExchanges for approval. You have complete control and visualization of the status of your Ad in each of the AdExchanges and you can also create rules for promoting these Ads.

## Managing Ads

### Creating a single Ad

1. In the Ads page, click on the <img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1).png" alt="Create" data-size="line"> button.
2.  Fill in the details:

    <figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Ad editor screen</p></figcaption></figure>

    * Name - how you want to call this ad;
    * Tags - up to 5 labels that can be used to aid identification and searching;
    * Domain - this is the primary domain that this ad will take the user when clicked;
    * Type - the type of ad, can be any common IAB size like "Large Leaderboard (970x90)", "Banner (468x60)", etc.
3. Choose a default creative group. You can pick one from the list, create a brand new one by clicking on ADD or edit the selected one by clicking on EDIT.
4. The option "Send for review on all supported ad exchanges" is checked by default but you can uncheck it if you want to further customize your ad before having it reviewed.
5. If all is correct, just click SAVE.

### Editing an Ad

To edit an Ad use the <img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/edit.png" alt="Edit" data-size="line"> button on the ad list. All fields are available for editing except the domain and type selectors.

### Editing Ad Rules

1. Select the Ad;
2. Click on Edit;
3. Name the rule you want to create;
4. Select the period, days of the week and times for your Ads to be available in the campaign. BMS will automatically activate and deactivate your Ads according to the rules you have created.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you don't change the rule, the platform will understand that your creative will run during the campaign period, on all days of the week and at any time. This area allows you to create periods for Ads to run within the same campaign, as well as their times and days of the week.
{% endhint %}

> Example: _Let's say that in the first half of the month you have a promotion for a 10% discount on products and in the second half of the month for a 20% discount. You could create two Ads with different creatives and create a period rule so that the platform makes this change automatically for you, without the need to create two different campaigns;_

#### Ad Exchange Review

1. After creating your Ad, select it to follow the approval or rejection of the Ad Exchanges;
2. Click on Exchange Review;
3. In Exchange Review you will see the status of your Ad as under review, approved or rejected. In the case of a rejection, you can see the justification in the Comments area;
4. If you want to resubmit your Ad, click on the submit arrow next to the name of the AdExchange you want to submit it to;
5. The approval time does not depend on the BMS, but on the Ad Exchange.

### Checking the status of an Ad

On the Ad list you can check at a glance if there are any issues with your configuration. You can move the mouse over the warning sign to see a description of the issue.

Once all issues are addressed the ad will display a green check.

### Archiving and Unarchiving an Ad

Ads that are not being used as often can be archived by clicking on the <img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/archive.png" alt="Archive" data-size="line"> button. Archiving an Ad does not prevent it from being used or displayed, just hides it from main view.

To see all archived ads simply turn on the <img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/archive filter.png" alt="Archived" data-size="line"> filter. You can unarchive <img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/unarchive.png" alt="Unarchive" data-size="line"> an Ad to make it show again on the main list.
