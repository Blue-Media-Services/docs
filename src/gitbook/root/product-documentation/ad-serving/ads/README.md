# Ads

In the Ads area you will create the Ads for your campaign, adding the group of creatives you want to send to the AdExchanges for approval. You have complete control and visualization of the status of your Ad in each of the AdExchanges and you can also create rules for promoting these Ads.

## <mark style="color:blue;">Creating an Ads</mark>

1. Name of your Ads;
2. Tag for your organization;
3. Campaign domain;
4. Choose the size of your banner;
5. Choose the Creative Groups you want to run your Ads;
6. Always check that the option to send to AdExchanges is active;
7. By saving, you have created your Ads and sent them for approval to all the AdExchanges available on the BMS.

### <mark style="color:blue;">Ad Rules</mark>

1. Select the Ad;
2. Click on Edit;
3. Name the rule you want to create;
4. Select the period, days of the week and times for your Ads to be available in the campaign. BMS will automatically activate and deactivate your Ads according to the rules you have created.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you don't change the rule, the platform will understand that your creative will run during the campaign period, on all days of the week and at any time. This area allows you to create periods for Ads to run within the same campaign, as well as their times and days of the week.
{% endhint %}

> Example: _Let's say that in the first half of the month you have a promotion for a 10% discount on products and in the second half of the month for a 20% discount. You could create two Ads with different creatives and create a period rule so that the platform makes this change automatically for you, without the need to create two different campaigns;_

### <mark style="color:blue;">Ad Exchange Review</mark>

1. After creating your Ad, select it to follow the approval or rejection of the Ad Exchanges;
2. Click on Exchange Review;
3. In Exchange Review you will see the status of your Ad as under review, approved or rejected. In the case of a rejection, you can see the justification in the Comments area;
4. If you want to resubmit your Ad, click on the submit arrow next to the name of the AdExchange you want to submit it to;
5. The approval time does not depend on the BMS, but on the Ad Exchange.

## <mark style="color:blue;">Editing an Ads</mark>

When editing all options remain available except the domain and type selections. Once created you cannot change the domain for an Ads.

## <mark style="color:blue;">Ads metrics and real time</mark>
