# Demand Side Platform (DSP)

In the DSP area, you will be using all features previously created like **Creatives**, **Creative Groups** and **Ads**, to start your campaign and customize it with more features to make it even more effective.&#x20;

This is the most important step since you will be deciding which public you want to focus your campaign on, the ads that will be displayed, and the budget available for each campaign.
