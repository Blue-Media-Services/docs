At BMS, it prioritizes transparency by displaying every detail of your bill. Visit our [Billing Home](../billing.md) to understand how the bills are structured.

### Budget Management and Media

In budget management and media, the bills related to BMS display the current budget availability, the requests generated when you change or set a budget for a campaign, and the media cost plus a 20% BMS tax. The media cost is based on the amount paid to a publisher to display your ad.

_**Example:** On this bill, a media cost of $4,014.89 plus CPM is noted. This cost is based on $3,345.74, which will be passed on to the publishers who displayed your ad, and an additional $669.15 from the 20% tax for using BMS's bidder. The campaign budget availability was also charged due to exceeding 1,000,000 requests. At a cost of $0.10 per 1,000,000 requests, this totaled $0.72. After adding up all bills, the total cost reached $4,015.61._

### Campaign Management

On the campaign management bill, the costs for any action on the campaign page and for campaign storage will be displayed. Each time you create, enable or disable campaigns, it counts as one request. If the number of requests exceeds 1,000 during a month, there will be a cost. Campaigns are charged even if they are inactive. BMS counts each second a campaign is listed, whether active or not, and converts seconds into hours, charging $0.75 per campaign per month, based on a 720-hour month.

_**Example:** In this case, since no requests have reached the first 1,000 mark, there will be no charges for actions performed on the campaigns page. However, since there were campaigns running or listed, a total of 2,201.09 campaign hours were charged, equivalent to about 3 campaigns running for an entire month. This resulted in a total cost of $2.29. Note that campaigns are charged for being listed, whether active or not, so deleting a campaign will stop further charges._

{% hint style="info" %}
All products generate metrics once you start using them. These metrics are charged and are crucial for understanding your BMS platform usage and performance. The monitoring tab is responsible for these metrics and will display the related bill.\
