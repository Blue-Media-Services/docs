## Overview Metrics

You can have a more precise view of your campaign by checking the <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (32) (1) (2).png" alt="Overview" data-size="line"> tab. Here you will be presented with the most valuable metrics of a campaign, which can be divided by **Targets**, **Ads**, **Creative Groups**, and **Creatives**.

To better understand the metrics displayed on the overview page, visit our [Campaign Metrics Tab](campaigns.md#metrics-tab).

It is possible to select a campaign and then choose a specific date to view the overview for that period.

After selecting a campaign and a period, you will be presented with an overview of that campaign, including all targets, ads, creative groups, and creatives that are impacting the campaign, and how they are performing.

It is also possible to check the top domains, apps, countries, regions, cities and devices for each campaign through the Overview tab. It presents the most relevant metrics and shows how each one is performing, providing you with valuable data to make strategic decisions.

{% hint style="info" %}
Some results might appear as "unspecified" due to user privacy settings or a lack of precise location data. However, ads are still delivered within the configured target. For example, if targeting a country, ads will only appear there, but results by region or city might show as "unspecified."
