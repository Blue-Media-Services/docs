You can have a more precise view of your campaign by checking the <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (32) (1).png" alt="Overview" data-size="line"> tab, here you will be presented with the most valuable metrics of a campaign, which can be divided by **Targets**, **Ads**, **Creative Groups**, and **Creatives**.

It is possible to select a campaign, and then a period of the overview you want to be presented to, by selecting a specific date.

After selecting a campaign and a period, you will be presented with an overview of that campaign and all Targets, ads, creative groups, and creatives that are causing an impact on that campaign, on how they are performing.

In every metric you will have a <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (38) (1).png" alt="Info" data-size="line"> which will precisely explain what that metric represents.

If you want, you can choose a metric and after selecting it you will be presented a broader view of that metric and also be presented the option to select a date and if necessary, you can download that as a .CSV file.
