{% endhint %}

Below is an explanation of each of these sections with their respective details.

### Ad Management

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (12).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Ad Management</p></figcaption></figure>

The ad management subsection will show you the bills related to the ad management process, such as ad storage, ad creation, ad requesting, ad listing, and ad patching.

_**Example**:_ _In the picture, there were almost 63 thousand ad hours consumed, which is equivalent to keeping nearly 88 ads active for a month (720 hours). This results in a bill of $8.80. Additionally, there were nearly 73 thousand ad requests; the first thousand were free, and after that, the ad requests were billed at $0.01 per thousand, resulting in a $0.73 bill. Therefore, the total Ad Management bill ($8.80 + $0.73) was $9.52._

### Ad Rendering

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (13).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Ad Rendering</p></figcaption></figure>

The ad rendering subsection will show you the bills related to the ad rendering service, such as the ad transfer and ad content requests.

_**Example**: You will notice that in this picture there were nearly 103 thousand ad content requests. The charge was $0.10 per 1,000 ad content requests, resulting in a $10.27 bill. It is also possible to notice that 0.57 GB of ad content data was transferred. The charge was $1.00 per GB transferred, costing $0.57 for the ad content data transferred. Since the ad container only has 56 requests and is charged $0.01 per 1,000 requests, it did not contribute to the final result, meaning the total Ad Rendering bill ($10.27 + $0.57) was $10.84._

### Ad Tracking

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (14).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Ad Tracking</p></figcaption></figure>

This subsection will contain the ad tracking bills, such as ad click tracking, ad display tracking, and ad view tracking.

_**Example**: In the image, you can observe that there was a free quota of 1,000 requests per service, after which billing starts. It is noticeable that this quota was not reached for the Ad Click Tracking service, meaning there will be no charges for this service. You can also observe that after reaching the quota, the Ad Display Tracking service is charged at $0.001 per 1,000 requests. There were nearly 93 thousand requests for this service, resulting in a $0.09 bill. Additionally, after the Track Ad View passed the 1,000 requests mark, it charged for the nearly 48 thousand requests, resulting in a $0.05 bill, reaching a total Ad Tracking bill of $0.14._

### Creative Builder Blueprint Management

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (15).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Creative Builder Blueprint Management.</p></figcaption></figure>

The Creative Builder Blueprint Management subsection will contain information about your bills related to the blueprint management process, including stored blueprints, blueprint requests, blueprint listings, blueprint patching, and blueprint rendering.

_**Example**: As you can observe in the image, except for storage, all other services have a free quota of 1,000 requests. Since none of them have reached the quota, there will be no charges related to them. Regarding storage, it was billed at $0.01 per blueprint per month (720 hours). Nearly 1,300 blueprint-hours were consumed in a month, which is equivalent to keeping 2 blueprints stored for a month, resulting in a $0.02 bill for storage._

### Creative Builder Build Management

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (16).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Creative Builder Build Management</p></figcaption></figure>

This subsection contains the billing information related to the builds management process, including builds stored, creating builds, requesting builds, listing builds, and patching builds.

_**Example**: You will notice that in this picture, except for the storage, there were no charges as the listed services had a free quota of 1,000 requests, which was not exceeded. The storage was charged $0.01 per build per month (720 hours). Nearly 5,000 build-hours were consumed, which is equivalent to keeping almost 7 builds stored for a month, resulting in a $0.07 bill._

### Creative Group Management

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (18).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Creative Group Management</p></figcaption></figure>

The creative group management subsection will contain billing information related to this process, including creating creative groups, storing creative groups, creative group requests, and creative group listings.

_**Example**: In this picture, you will notice that there was a free quota of 1,000 requests for each service, except for storage. Since the quota was not exceeded for these services, there will be no charges. Storage was billed at $0.10 per creative group per month (720 hours). Nearly 60,000 creative group hours were consumed, resulting in an $8.39 bill, which is equivalent to almost 84 creative groups stored for a month (720 hours)._

### Creative Management

This subsection contains billing information related to creative management, including creating creatives, storing creatives, requesting creatives, listing creatives, patching creatives, and sending creatives for review.

_**Example**: In the picture, you can observe that there was a free quota of 1,000 requests per service, except for storage. Since none of these services exceeded the quota, there will be no charges. Storage was billed at $0.10 per creative per month (720 hours). With a little more than 74,000 creative-hours consumed, the resulting bill is $10.30, which is equivalent to storing almost 103 creatives for a month (720 hours)._

### Domain Management

After exceeding this quota, the service was billed $0.01 per 1,000 requests. With nearly 15,000 requests made, the resulting bill is $0.15. The other service did not exceed the free quota, so there will be no charges for it._
