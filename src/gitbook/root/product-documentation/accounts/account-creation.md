<summary>Is there a charge to create an account?</summary>

No, creating an account is completely free. We only charge for the services you use on the platform. A small, temporary charge may appear on your credit card for validation purposes, but it will be immediately refunded.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How do I manage my account once it's created?</summary>

You can manage your billing information, account details, and users directly from your dashboard once you have successfully logged in.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Who should create the account?</summary>

The account can be created by anyone who has the necessary information to do so. For agencies, this depends on their strategy. The most recommended approach is to have the client create the account with their own data. This ensures the client's account isn't inseparably linked to the agency, allowing them to maintain control and access to all data generated from their paid campaigns. If the client decides to end their contract or not renew with the agency, they can remove the agency's users from the account, keeping all the account data.

Another approach is for the agency to create an account for the client under its organization. However, this links the account to the agency's primary account, which can complicate the migration process if the client later decides to switch agencies or manage their account independently.

<summary>Why is a credit card necessary?</summary>

We require a credit card during the registration process to eliminate the need for a manual credit approval or review. This allows your account to be created automatically and instantly, so you can start using the platform right away. If you want to know about other payment methods we might accept, please contact our sales team.
