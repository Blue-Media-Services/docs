# Cookie Pools

A Cookie Pool is a collection or database of user cookies that is maintained by an organization, typically an advertising or marketing company. Cookies are small pieces of data that are stored in a user's web browser when they visit a website. These cookies can contain information about the user's online behavior, preferences, and interactions with websites and online services.

In the context of digital advertising and marketing, a cookie pool can serve several purposes:

1. **Audience Segmentation:** Advertisers and marketers use cookie pools to segment users into different groups based on their interests, behaviors, demographics, or other criteria. This segmentation allows for more targeted and personalized advertising campaigns.
2. **Retargeting:** Cookie pools are often used for retargeting campaigns. When a user visits a website and leaves without making a purchase, for example, their cookie data can be added to a pool. Later, that user can be shown ads related to the products or services they viewed on other websites as they browse the internet.
3. **Ad Personalization:** Cookie pools help in delivering personalized ads to users. By analyzing the data stored in the cookies, advertisers can determine which ads are most relevant to specific users, increasing the chances of engagement.
4. **Analytics and Measurement:** Advertisers use cookie data to track the performance of their campaigns. They can measure metrics such as click-through rates, conversion rates, and user engagement to assess the effectiveness of their advertising efforts.
5. **Frequency Capping:** Cookie pools also enable advertisers to set frequency caps, which limit how often a particular ad is shown to a user within a certain time frame. This helps prevent users from being bombarded with the same ad repeatedly.
