For an Ad to work, it is necessary to create a rule, you will decide when the ad will be displayed, if you have not created the rule through our Ad Creation steps, follow the steps below.

To start creating an Ad rule, select an ad and move to the <img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (434).png" alt="Rules" data-size="line"> tab.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (961).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Rules</p></figcaption></figure>

To create a rule, click on <img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (962).png" alt="Add Rule" data-size="line">.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/Captura de tela 2025-03-27 075457.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Editing Rules</p></figcaption></figure>

On your rule creation, you will be able to select the time frame in which your ad will be displayed.

* **Name**:  Inform a name for the rule.
* **Use Single Creative**: Select this option to apply this rule to a single creative.
* **Use Creative Group**: Select this option to apply this rule to a creative group.
* **Scheduling**: You can schedule your ads to be displayed on certain days or time window, making it possible to fully customize when your ads will be displayed.
* **Display**: Set a starting date and when the rule stops, you can always edit this date when necessary.

After making all necessary customizations, click on <img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (433).png" alt="Save" data-size="line">.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (964).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Rules Configured</p></figcaption></figure>

Once you configure your rule, a week preview will be shown as well as the hours per week that your ad will be displayed. To make any necessary changes, click on ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (965).png>) and you will be able to make changes.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you do not change the rule, the platform will understand that your creative will run during the campaign period, on all days of the week, and at any time. This area allows you to create periods for Ads to run within the same campaign, as well as their times and days of the week.
{% endhint %}

You can create multiple rules for the same Ad, and enable or disable them as you wish. Just flip the<img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (966).png" alt="Toggle" data-size="line"> to decide which rules will be used.

_**Example**: Let's say that in the first half of the month, you have a promotion for a 10% discount on products and in the second half of the month for a 20% discount. You could create two Ads with different creatives and create a period rule so that the platform makes this change automatically for you, without the need to create two different campaigns._

## Exchange Reviews

Once you create your ads, it is necessary for certain exchanges to review your ad in order to display it on their inventory. You can check your exchange review status by clicking on <img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (967).png" alt="Exchange Reviews" data-size="line">.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (968).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Exchange Reviews</p></figcaption></figure>

If you did not check the Send for Review on your Ad creation, you will be able to send your ad for review by clicking on <img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (969).png" alt="Send" data-size="line">.

Should your ad review fail for any reason, you can check more details [here](ad-exchange-review/) on how to correctly identify the error and how to fix it.

Alternatively, you can use the bulk actions to send ads for exchange review in bulk. This option is available when selecting at least 2 ads, then clicking on <img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1104).png" alt="" data-size="line"> and selecting "Send For Review".

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/Captura de tela 2025-05-09 140645.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Send for Review - Bulk Actions</p></figcaption></figure>

## Archiving and Unarchiving an Ad

Ads that are not being used as often can be archived by clicking on the <img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/archive.png" alt="Archive" data-size="line"> button. Archiving an Ad does not prevent it from being used or displayed; it only hides it from the main view.

To see all archived ads, simply turn on the <img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/archive filter.png" alt="Archived" data-size="line"> filter. You can unarchive <img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/unarchive.png" alt="Unarchive" data-size="line"> an Ad to make it show again on the main list.
