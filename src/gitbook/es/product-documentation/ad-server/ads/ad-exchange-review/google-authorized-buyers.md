### Adult Content

Explicit adult content is not allowed on the ad network. Some adult-oriented ads and landing pages are allowed but will be shown in limited scenarios based on user searches, user age, and local laws.

Below is a table where you can check if your creative presents any of the following examples. If it does, you will need to make adjustments to your creative before resubmitting the ad for review.

<table><thead><tr><th width="270">Category</th><th width="166">Restriction Level*</th><th>Example</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Partial Nudity</td><td>Moderate</td><td>Lower or outer curve of the female breast exposed, majority of buttocks exposed</td></tr><tr><td>Sexualized Theme Dating</td><td>Moderate</td><td>Affair dating, sexual fetish dating</td></tr><tr><td>Sexual Merchandise</td><td>Moderate</td><td>Sex toys, lubricants, aphrodisiacs, sexual enhancers, sexual fetish lingerie</td></tr><tr><td>Sexual Entertainment</td><td>Moderate</td><td>Strip clubs, adult movie festivals, sexually suggestive live streaming or live chat, sexually suggestive role playing games</td></tr><tr><td>Mature Cosmetic Procedures</td><td>Moderate</td><td>Female breast augmentation, penis enlargement surgery, vaginal laser rejuvenation, buttock implants, pubic hair grooming</td></tr><tr><td>Sexually Suggestive Elements and Theme</td><td>Moderate</td><td>Lewd or sexual language, images featuring legs spread open, touching covered intimate body parts, mimicking sexual positions or movements, dating for general audiences that includes more sexually suggestive imagery</td></tr><tr><td>Nudity</td><td>Strong</td><td>Visible genitalia, female breasts, or buttocks</td></tr><tr><td>Sexual Encounter Dating</td><td>Strong</td><td>Hook-up or fling dating, swinger dating sites</td></tr></tbody></table>

\***Restriction Level:**

* **Moderate** - Ads that feature or promote the following types of sexual content categories are moderately restricted. They will only serve based on the following conditions:
  * The user’s age, the local laws where the ad is being served, and the user’s Safe Search settings.
* **Strong** - Ads that feature or promote the following types of sexual content are strongly restricted. They will only serve based on the following conditions:
  * The user’s age, the local laws where the ad is being served, and the user’s Safe Search settings.
  * The user’s sexual content Search queries.

Once you receive a rejection for your ad, identify which example better suits your creative and make the necessary changes. After making the changes, resend the ad for review. If the changes made are correct, the ad will not be rejected.

### Destination Not Crawlable

Google requires that the destination and content of ads be accessible to the Google AdsBot web crawlers, ensuring that users are redirected to the correct destination after clicking on the ad.

In this scenario, the ads would be disapproved due to an untrackable destination.

Make sure Googlebot is allowed to crawl your landing page by checking your robots.txt file.

Below are some restrictions and errors you may have and how to identify them.

|            Error           |                                                       Context                                                       |                                                                                                                                                                              Example                                                                                                                                                                              |

* Social casino game destinations that offers gambling or games where the opportunity exists to win real money or prizes based on the outcome of the game.
* Promotion of "real money gambling" destinations. This includes gambling-related advertisements that appear on your social casino game destination.

Below, you can check the requirements for each country.

### Ad Network Abuse

We want ads across our network to be useful, varied, relevant, and safe for users. Advertisers are not allowed to run ads, content, or destinations that attempt to deceive or bypass our ad review processes.

Here are some examples of practices to avoid in your ads:

Violations of this policy are taken very seriously and considered egregious, especially when they are unlawful or pose significant harm to users. In assessing compliance, Google may review multiple sources, including ads, websites, accounts, and third-party information.

### Removed By Google

It is possible for a Google-approved ad to be removed later due to policy changes or errors in Google's daily checks. Google's re-evaluation might determine that your ad now violates a rule, leading to its removal.

A common solution for this situation is to resubmit your ad for review. This allows Google to either approve it again or provide the correct rejection status if it still violates a rule.

### Revoked By Google

During a campaign, you might stop using some ads, and Google may revoke these ads after a period of inactivity. Google performs daily checks, and if your ad is not being used regularly, it may be revoked. Once you resubmit the ad for review, it should be approved.
