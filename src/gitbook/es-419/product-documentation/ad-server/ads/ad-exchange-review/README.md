# Revisión de Ad Exchange

Some ad exchanges require a review of your ad before displaying it in their inventory to ensure compliance with their pre-established rules. Once the review is complete, the ad exchange will inform you whether the ad is approved or rejected, along with the reason for rejection.

Reviewing ads is essential to prevent inappropriate content from being displayed on websites that do not accept such content.

Please note that sometimes an ad exchange's rejection might not provide an accurate status for your review. Therefore, make sure to resend your ad for review to double-check the rejection status.
