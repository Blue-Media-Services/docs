# Managing Campaigns

### Creating a Campaign

In the Campaigns Area click on <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (252) (1).png" alt="Create Campaign" data-size="line">.

Fill in the details.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (238) (1).png" alt="Campaign Creation"><figcaption><p>Campaign Creation</p></figcaption></figure>

* Name - Choose a name for your campaign;
* Tags - up to 5 labels that can be used to aid identification and searching;
* Domain - this is the primary domain that this campaign will take the user when clicked;
* Time Zone – which time zone you want to deliver your campaign;
* Scheduling - set your start and ending date for the Campaign;
* Bid Price – this is where you will be deciding your bidding price for the AD’s auction;
  * Fixed - Set your immutable price for an inventory slot;
  * Variable - Activate this option to use our technology "**Bid Shading**", which is the platform's own bidder; if activated, it will optimize your budget spend, always focusing on the fairest value for purchasing those inventory spaces. This generates significant savings, although the company may choose not to activate Bid Shading and let the bidding offer be based solely on the CPM target.
* Frequency Cap: Amount of impressions per device, here you can change how many times the campaign will be shown to each device;

{% hint style="warning" %}
_Attention! The higher the Frequency Cap, the more you'll appear to the same user. The lower the Frequency Cap, you'll reach more users and appear less often to each of them._
{% endhint %}

After filling in all fields, click on ![Save](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (253) (1).png>), if there is any invalid field, it will be shown so you can review what is missing.

This will be your view after successfully creating a campaign.

Configure your [Budget](budgets.md), [Targets](targets.md) and [Ads](managing-ads.md).

### Enabling your Campaign

To enable your campaign, you **must** have at least one Target and Ad added to the campaign, you can also check the <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (76).png" alt="" data-size="line"> sign to see whether there is any issue preventing you from enabling the campaign.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If this notice appears in the status of your creative, ad, or campaign, it means that the material was not approved by the platform or ad exchanges. In this case, BMS will inform you of the issue in question (in detail) by hovering the cursor on the sign, and you can make the necessary adjustments before activation.
{% endhint %}

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Campaigns (1).jpeg" alt="Campaign"><figcaption><p>Campaign</p></figcaption></figure>

To enable your campaign simply flip the Enable toggle.

### Share Ad Preview <a href="#share-a-d-preview" id="share-a-d-preview"></a>

You can preview your ad and share the preview link with your clients. With this feature, they can access and view the ads running on BMS without needing to log in to the platform. This improves the review process, ensures greater transparency, and keeps everyone aligned on creative updates. Additionally, it allows clients to evaluate the ads from anywhere, at any time.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that this feature is only available within the DSP area, in the Campaigns section.
{% endhint %}

To preview your ad, select one or more campaigns and then click on ![Preview](data:image/png;base64,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).
