# Monitoring Billing

In the monitoring tab, it will be presented all bills related to monitoring, which are divided into 4 sub-sections.

### Event Pipe Management

Every action taken on an event pipe will generate a request. For instance, creating an event pipe, listing your event pipes, and making changes to an event pipe will each generate a request. Additionally, each event pipe will create event logs per hour, which will then be charged based on a 720-hour period.

_**Example:**_ _On this bill, only the configured event pipe has been charged. By observing the number of hours, you can see that the configured event pipe has been active for a month and a few days, resulting in a total bill of $0.79. No other charges occurred since no requests exceeded the first 1,000 free requests._

### Event Store Management

On the Event Store page, all actions will count as a request. If you access the page, create an event store, check your available event streams, or download an event stream, each of these actions will count as a request. However, downloading an event stream will also incur charges, as will storing event streams. These charges will be based on the size of the event stream and the duration it is stored in BMS.

_**Example:** On this bill, it is possible to see that most requests were not charged due to not reaching the free 1,000 requests. However, the event store requests incurred a $1.95 bill due to the high number of event streams generated within that event store. Having a configured event store also incurred charges because event streams are generated every hour, resulting in a $0.47 bill. Additionally, storing these generated event streams on the BMS server (if the webhook feature is not used) incurred a $0.04 bill, bringing the total bill to $2.46._

### Metric Monitoring

All metrics on any platform incur charges and are crucial for analyzing performance and making strategic decisions based on the collected data. BMS centralizes the charges for every metric on the platform under the Monitoring tab, which is responsible for receiving all events within the platform.

Metrics are charged per point recorded and for the bytes processed by BMS's servers to generate these metrics.

_**Example:** On this bill, it is noted that nearly 17 million metric points were accumulated within a month. This total is generated by summing all the metrics on the user's account, resulting in a cost of $83.47. Additionally, the amount of data scanned to generate these metrics was nearly 119 thousand GB, resulting in a charge of $2.37, for a total bill of $85.84._

### Real Time Monitoring

Some products have a real-time tab that displays events from your campaign as they happen. For example, when an ad is displayed, the user's location will be shown based on the ad exchange used, along with additional information. Each time the real-time tab is accessed, it will incur costs.

_**Example:** In this case, the requests for recent real-time events were relatively low but exceeded the 100,000 free events mark, resulting in a charge of $0.14._
