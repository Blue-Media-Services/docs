# Monitoring

In our Monitoring section, you will be able to create event stores and pipes related to all of our products and your currently active campaigns. This will provide you with valuable data to study better solutions for your campaigns and improve your strategy.

## Event Stores

It is possible to create numerous event stores to store data and set your own data retention settings, allowing you to adjust the retention according to your planning. [Learn More about Event Stores](event-stores.md).

## Event Pipes

Here you will decide which events you will collect data from, ranging from an active campaign to any event that happens within our platform. This provides ample data to help you keep track of any important product that you are focused on. [Learn More about Event Pipes](event-pipes.md).
