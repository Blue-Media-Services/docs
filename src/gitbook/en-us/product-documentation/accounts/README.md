## Organization

The organization is a feature that allows you to better track your results and investments by compartmentalizing them under different accounts. This means a brand can have a separate account for each of its campaigns or products, or a publicity agency can have a separate account for each of its clients. Having an account for each objective helps achieve better tracking, as the data obtained on the account that was dedicated to it, will be referring to a single objective, product or client.

Only the main account will have access to the organization settings, while the other accounts in the organization will have access only to their own data.

As you can see, the service quotas list provides data about the default quota and the current quota for your services. You can also observe that we have a column for adjustability, which indicates whether a quota can be adjusted.

In the column action, you will find the adjust quota request button <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (25) (1) (1).png" alt="" data-size="original">. Click on it in the same row as the quota you need to increase to open a quota adjustment request.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (18) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Service Quotas Adjustment Request</p></figcaption></figure>

The editable values in the requests are the quota value and the reason for requesting this adjustment. After filling in these details, click on ![Request](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (429).png>) to send your request to our support team. Our team will analyze your request, and if everything is in order, they will approve it.

There is a 'History' tab on the service quotas page. To view your requests, select the related service quotas from the service quotas list. In this tab, you'll be able to view your request history.:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (27) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Service Quotas - History tab</p></figcaption></figure>

As you can see, there are some status for you to follow your request as it is being analyzed by our support team:

* **Pending:** Your request was received, but our team has not analyzed it yet.
* **Rejected:** Our team has analyzed your request and for some reason, it was refused.
* **Approved:** Our team has analyzed your request, it was approved, and your quota has been adjusted.
* **Canceled:** Your request was canceled by the account administrator. If the quota adjustment was approved before it was canceled, the given quota will be redefined to the default values.

You can visualize your request at any time, independently of its status, by clicking on ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (29) (1).png>) at the same row as the request you need to access. If your request has been refused, the reason for the refusal will also be available here.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Attention! This action cannot be undone, be careful when canceling requests, if you already are using the given extra quota, services relying on this might stop working.
{% endhint %}

It is also possible to cancel your requests by clicking on <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (31) (1).png" alt="" data-size="original"> and then ![Cancel](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (430) (5).png>) to confirm your action. If the requests were approved before you cancel it, the given quota will be redefined to the default values.

## Account Restrictions

There are some restrictions that might be applied to your account under different circumstances. When your account is restricted, you may be unable to use the platform until the restriction is revoked.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (368) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Access Denied - Error</p></figcaption></figure>

The picture above shows the message displayed when your account has been restricted, or when you're trying to access something without the necessary permissions from the account administrator. If you believe this is the case, please contact our support team for more information about the restriction applied and what is needed to revoke it.

You can also check if your account is restricted using our [API](https://api.bluems.com/docs/acc/z2duu26luwyr9-list-account-restrictions).
